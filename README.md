# Pychame

## Why Pychame?

Pychame provides a simple and convenient way to access and utilize the integrated camera of a Chromebook within the OpenCV library. It eliminates the complexities of setting up camera access and enables seamless integration with OpenCV for capturing and processing camera frames.

## Key Features

- Easy integration: Pychame simplifies the process of accessing the Chromebook camera and integrating it with OpenCV.
- Real-time camera capture: Pychame allows you to capture camera frames in real-time, enabling various computer vision and image processing applications.
- Efficient performance: Pychame optimizes the camera capture process to ensure smooth and efficient frame retrieval.
- Compatibility: Pychame is designed specifically for Chromebook devices, leveraging their unique camera capabilities.
- HTTPS support: Pychame includes HTTPS support for secure camera frame transmission over the network.

## Installation

You can install Pychame using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
    $ pip install pychame
```

## Usage

To use Pychame in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the Pychame class:

```python
    from pychame.video import Video
```

2. Create an instance of the Pychame class:

```python
    video = Video()
```

3. Use the Read() method to retrieve camera frames:

```python
    frame, success = video.Read()
```

4. Process the captured frame using OpenCV or perform any desired operations.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to continuously capture frames in real-time.

6. When you're finished, release the resources using the Release() method:

```python
    video.Release()
```

7. Enter in the [local server](https://0.0.0.0:5000) to start the camera

## Example

Here's an example that demonstrates the basic usage of Pychame:

```python
    from pychame.video import Video
    import cv2

    video = Video()

    while True:
        frame, success = video.Read()

        if not success:
            continue

        cv2.imshow("Camera Frame", frame)


        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    video.Release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Limitations

1. Pychame is specifically designed for Chromebooks and may not work with other operating systems or devices.
2. The performance of Pychame may vary depending on the hardware capabilities of the Chromebook and the complexity of the image processing tasks being performed.

## Conclusion

Pychame simplifies the process of using the integrated camera of a Chromebook with OpenCV, enabling you to build computer vision applications and perform real-time image processing tasks. It provides an intuitive interface and optimized performance, making it an ideal choice for Chromebook users interested in computer vision development.
